      jobTitle: Electron Contributor
      company: University of Melbourne
      bio: I'm a 20-year-old student, I grew up in the UK and NZ but I'm currently studying Computer Science in Melbourne, Australia. I've been an active Electron contributor since early 2016 and built many modules and utilities to assist in the development of Electron apps. I'm really excited about the future of Electron apps, even the progress we have made as a community in the last year alone is amazing and I'm hoping to share some of the awesome bits of that progress.
